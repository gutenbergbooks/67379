<h2 class="large">PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The favour with which our former compilation&mdash;the “Cyclopædia of
Poetical Quotations”&mdash;was received, and the numerous calls which we had
for an extension of the plan of that work, induced us to determine on
the issue of this companion volume, which, although exactly similar in
size and price, and method of arrangement, yet possesses a decidedly
distinctive feature in the <i>sacred</i> character of all the pieces
included. We have endeavoured to make it one of the most complete
collections of <span class="smcap">Religious Poetry</span> ever offered to the public;
and cannot doubt that, as such, it will be acceptable to a very large
class of readers. As the matter in this volume had to be arranged
under a far less number of distinct headings than that of the work
above named, there was space for the introduction of longer pieces,
and thus many of the most beautiful specimens of devotional poetry,
which are to be found in the literature of this and other nations, are
given with little or no curtailment. Although there is much poetry of a
religious character scattered through the former volume, yet&mdash;inasmuch
as it is presumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span> that most persons who possess the one will also
desire to have the other&mdash;none of the pieces which may there be found
are admitted into this compilation, except in some cases where it was
felt that by re-uniting the portions there arranged under several
headings, so complete and beautiful a whole could be presented, that
its insertion here was almost rendered necessary.</p>

<p>As we wished to make our volume entirely <i>unsectarian</i> in its
character, we have endeavoured to avoid the insertion of poems which
involve merely doctrinal points. Those grand truths and principles of
Christianity on which all denominations of the Saviour’s professed
followers are agreed, offered ample scope for poetic illustration;
and happily we could, alike from the pages of a Milton, a Watts, a
Doddridge, a Wesley, a Montgomery, and a Keble, find plenty of matter
for our purpose, without entering at all upon the thorny paths of
controversy. The introduction of Scripture quotations at the head of
each subject will, we apprehend, be considered a useful feature of our
compilation. As might be expected, the noblest poetry that ever was
written is to be found in the inspired volume, and those passages which
we have selected therefrom, as specimens of poetic composition alone,
will, we apprehend, be considered the true gems of the collection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span></p>

<p>While we are upon the subject of Scripture quotations, we may perhaps
be allowed to place before our readers a fine passage from Gilfillan’s
“Bards of the Bible,” in reference thereto:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The charm which Scripture quotation adds to writing, let those tell
who have read Milton, Bunyan, Burke, Foster, Southey, Croly, Carlyle,
Macaulay, yea, and even Byron, all of whom have sown their pages
with this ‘orient pearl’ and brought thus an impulse from divine
inspiration, to add to the effect of their own. Extracts from the
Bible always attest and vindicate their origin. They nerve what else
in the sentence in which they occur is pointless; they clear a space
for themselves, and cast a wide glory around the page where they are
found. Taken from the <i>classics</i> of the <i>heart</i>, all hearts vibrate
more or less strongly to their voice. It is even as David felt of old
toward the sword of Goliath, when he visited the high-priest, and said,
‘There is none like that, give it me;’ so writers of true taste and
sympathies feel on great occasions, when they have certain thoughts and
feelings to express, a longing for that sharp two-edged sword, and an
irresistible inclination to cry ‘None like that, give it us; this right
Damascus blade alone can cut the way of our thought into full utterance
and victory.’”</p>

<p>From the Psalms of David, as giving expression in the most poetical and
devotional form, to almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span> every variety of passion and emotion of
which the human mind is cognizant, we have, of course, taken a large
proportion of our Scripture passages, and therefore do we think it well
to quote the above author’s apostrophe to these sublime compositions.</p>

<p>“Wild, holy, tameless strains, how have you run down through ages in
which large poems, systems, and religions have perished, firing the
souls of poets, kissing the lips of children, smoothing the pillows of
the dying, stirring the warrior to heroic rage, perfuming the chambers
of solitary saints, and clasping into one the hearts and voices of
thousands of assembled worshippers; tinging many a literature, and
finding a home in many a land; and still ye seem as fresh, and young,
and powerful as ever; yea, preparing for even mightier triumphs than
when first chanted! Britain, Germany, and America now sing you; but you
must yet awaken the dumb millions of China and Japan.”</p>

<p>It has been beautifully and truly observed by the eloquent and learned
Bishop Lowth, that “We shall think of Poetry much more humbly than it
deserves, unless we direct our attention to that quarter where its
importance is most eminently conspicuous, or unless we contemplate it
as employed on sacred subjects, and in subservience to religion. This
indeed appears to have been the original office and destination of
Poetry, and this it still so happily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span> performs, that in all other cases
it seems out of character, as if intended for this purpose alone. In
other instances Poetry appears to want the assistance of art, and in
this to shine forth with all its natural splendour, or rather to be
animated by that inspiration, which on other occasions is spoken of
without being felt.”</p>

<p>These observations apply more especially to Hebrew Poetry, that
loftiest and noblest manifestation of true poetic inspiration; and are
quoted by Dr. Caunter in his able and judicious treatise on “The Poetry
of the Pentateuch,” in reference to which the learned writer observes
that “Sacred themes have inspired the greatest poets of almost every
age, and of every civilized country where the true God has been adored,
the doctrine of redemption promulgated, and the divine attributes
avowed. Those sublime themes have called forth the highest intellectual
endowments of man.” Herder, another profound critic, and lover of
Poetry in its most sublime forms, says of it, that “without God it is a
showy Papyrus without moisture; every system of morals without Him is a
mere parasitical plant. It makes a flowery display in fine words, and
sends forth its branches hither and thither; nay, it insinuates itself
into every weak spot and crevice of the human soul; but the sun rises
and it vanishes.”</p>

<p>All true Poets have felt and known this, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span> they have not always
acknowledged it; sometimes it was but a dim confused perception of the
truth which they obtained; being dazzled by the blaze of their own
genius, they have mistaken that for a divine effluence, and worshipped
it in the place of that greater glory, of which it was but a faint
reflex and emanation. Sometimes it was pride of intellect which forbade
them to bow down to any other God than that which bore the impress of
self: sometimes it was a kind of pantheistic worship of nature, as an
abstract divinity; so enamoured were they of the fair face of creation,
that they forgot the Creator; the works, how beautiful! how perfect!
But the workman, what of Him? We have spoken in the past tense, and it
might be thought that our remarks were meant to apply to poets of pagan
lands, and of benighted ages of the world’s history; but alas! they are
equally applicable to all ages, and to all lands; and especially to our
own country and age of Christian enlightenment. Many of the most gifted
singers of the present day, of the most fervent and devoted spirits,
might have served as high-priests in the temple of Apollo, and offered
adoration at the shrine of Flora, Ceres, and the Bona Dea, and other
pagan impersonifications of the sun, and the earth, with its beauties
and riches. To such as these the flowers, those stars of earth, are
not the living, glowing, breathing “charactery”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span> in which the Almighty
writes instructive lessons of His wisdom and goodness, telling the
sick, the weary, and the sad at heart, that</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza smaller">
        <div class="ileft">“Whoso careth for the flowers</div>
        <div class="i1">Will care much more for them.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>To such the stars, those flowers of heaven, are not bright revelations
of the Deity who sustains and directs them in their courses.</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza smaller">
        <div class="ileft">“For ever singing as they shine,</div>
        <div>The hand that made us is divine.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>To such the whispering gales, the rustling boughs, the humming insects,
the singing rills, and the warbling birds, speak not of an ever
watchful, ever wakeful Power, to which in every emergency the prayerful
soul may turn. Calm and soothing as is doubtless the influence of
nature, upon the troubled souls of all who submit themselves to her
gentle teachings, yet with how much greater satisfaction and delight
must those contemplate her beauties and share her calm enjoyments,
who see in her various changes and aspects but so many revelations of
Almighty love, and read in her fair lineaments the wondrous story of
redeeming grace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">

        <div class="ileft">“Alas! that mankind sees Him not,&mdash;the Great</div>
        <div>And Everlasting Framer of all worlds;</div>
        <div>Who paints himself upon the leaves of flowers,</div>

        <div>Of suns, and moons, and planetary systems,”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">as J. Stanyan Bigg, the latest, but not the least, of the
true poets of the present cycle, has finely said. We must give another
extract from his “Night and the Soul,” published too late for quotation
in the body of our volume:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza smaller">
        <div class="ileft">“Nature is still, as ever, the thin veil</div>
        <div>Which half conceals, and half reveals the face</div>
        <div>And lineaments supernal of our King,&mdash;</div>
        <div>The modifying medium through which</div>
        <div>His glories are exhibited to man,&mdash;</div>
        <div>The grand repository where he hides</div>
        <div>His mighty thoughts to be dug out like diamonds;&mdash;</div>
        <div>Still is the day irradiate with His glory,</div>
        <div>Flowing in steady, sun-streaked, ocean gush</div>
        <div>From His transcendant nature,&mdash;still at night</div>
        <div>O’er our horizon trail the sable robes</div>
        <div>Of the Eternal One, with all their rich</div>
        <div>Embroidery and emblazonment of stars.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>This is high and holy teaching. Well were it if every mere
nature-worshipper could be brought to the same conviction as the poet
of “Night and the Soul,” and confess that&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza smaller">
        <div class="ileft">“Religion is the true Philosophy!</div>
        <div>Faith is the last great link ’twixt God and man.</div>
        <div>There is more wisdom in a whispered prayer</div>
        <div>Than in the ancient lore of all the schools:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></div>
        <div>The soul upon its knees holds God by the hand.</div>
        <div>Worship is wisdom as it is in heaven!</div>

        <div>Is the last greatest utterance of the soul.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>“I do believe!” how few are there among the gifted children of song,
who can stoop from the lofty heights of intellectual glory, to utter
this confession of the insufficiency of human reason, the littleness of
human power.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza smaller">
        <div class="ileft">“Stoop, stoop, proud man! the gate of heaven is low,</div>
        <div>And all who enter in thereat must bend!</div>
        <div>Reason has fields to play in, wide as air,</div>
        <div>But they have bounds; and if she soar beyond,</div>
        <div>Lo! there are lightnings and the curse of God.</div>
        <div>And the old thundered ‘Never!’ from the jaws</div>
        <div>Of the black darkness and the mocking waste.</div>
        <div>Come not to God with questions on thy lips,</div>
        <div>He will have love&mdash;love and a holy trust.</div>
        <div>And the self-abnegation of a child.</div>
        <div>’Tis a far higher wisdom to believe,</div>
        <div>Than to cry ‘Question’ at the porch of truth.</div>
        <div>Think not the Infinite will calmly brook</div>
        <div>The plummet of the finite in its depths.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>God and His attributes are undoubtedly the poet’s noblest themes, and
to celebrate the greatness and glory of His works, the wonders of His
power, and the riches of His grace, have the highest efforts of human
genius in all ages been directed. From the time when Moses sung his
song of triumph as the waters closed over Pharaoh and his host, when
the Prophets uttered their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span> rapt predictions, and the inspired Psalmist
sent forth those strains of supplication and thanksgiving which are
still sounding daily in our ears, and stirring our hearts to devotion,
down to the period when Milton wrote his great epic,</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza smaller">
        <div class="ileft">“Of man’s first disobedience, and the fruit</div>
        <div>Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste</div>
        <div>Brought death into the world,”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">has the lyre been consecrated to the service of
religion&mdash;has religious poetry been the most beautiful and touching, as
well as the most lofty and sublime of all poetry. As Dr. Caunter well
observes, “The noblest epics which have elicited the poetic genius of
different countries, have been based upon subjects either immediately
connected with, or remotely allied to, religion. The authors of the
Mahabarat and the Ramayana, two Hindoo epics of high celebrity and
extraordinary magnitude, extending each to several hundred thousand
lines, of the Iliad and the Odyssey, of the Inferno, of the Jerusalem
Delivered, of the Paradise Lost and Regained, have, either directly or
consequentially, all made the Deity and His illimitable perfections the
subjects of their immortal song.”</p>

<p>And so it is; every true poet is essentially a religious poet; his
religion may not be Christianity, his views of the divine nature and
attributes may be distorted, and he may be altogether ignorant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
the great truths of scripture revelation, yet there will ever be in

<p>Alas! how often has been, and is, this noble gift of poesy abused and
prostituted to base purposes; of how few could it be said that he had
written no line which dying he might wish to blot. Dryden, we may
remember, exclaims</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Yet even he cannot altogether escape the reproach conveyed in these
lines to such as have, at times, shown themselves unworthy of the
sacred gift, and of this he appears to be conscious when he says “how
far have <i>we</i>,” etc. Cowper might with great propriety act the censor
on such a dereliction of duty, and say&mdash;</p>

<p>So also might one of the sacred poets of our own day, many of whose
strains of simple, earnest, and pure devotion, will be found in our

<h2>DEATH.</h2>


<p class="smaller"><span class="smcap">Let</span> me <i>die</i> the <i>death</i> of the righteous, and let my last end be like
his!&mdash;Numbers, xxiii. 10.</p>

<p class="smaller">But now he is <i>dead</i>, wherefore should I fast? Can I bring him back
again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me. II. Samuel,
xii. 23.</p>

<p class="smaller">What man is he that liveth, and shall not see <i>death</i>? Shall he deliver
his soul from the hand of the grave?&mdash;Psalm lxxxix. 48.</p>

<p class="smaller">Precious in the sight of the Lord is the <i>death</i> of His saints.&mdash;Psalm
cxvi. 15.</p>

<p class="smaller">Weep ye not for the <i>dead</i>, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for
him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native
country.&mdash;Jeremiah, xxii. 10.</p>

<p class="smaller">O <i>death</i>, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</p>

<p class="smaller">The sting of <i>death</i> is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</p>

<p class="smaller">But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord
Jesus Christ.&mdash;I. Corinthians, xv. 55, 56, 57.</p>

<p class="smaller">But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them
which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</p>

<p class="smaller">For if we believe that Jesus <i>died</i> and rose again, even so them also
which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.&mdash;I. Thessalonians, iv.
13, 14.</p>

<p class="smaller">Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He
also himself likewise took part of the same; that through <i>death</i> He
might destroy him that had the power of <i>death</i>, that is, the devil,</p>

<p class="smaller">And deliver them who through fear of <i>death</i> were all their lifetime
subject to bondage.&mdash;Hebrews, ii. 14, 15.</p>

<p class="smaller">Blessed are the <i>dead</i> which <i>die</i> in the Lord from henceforth: Yea,
saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their
works do follow them.&mdash;Revelations, xiv. 13.</p>

hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto
the <i>resurrection</i> of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
<i>resurrection</i> of damnation.&mdash;John, v. 28, 29.</p>

<p class="smaller">I am the <i>resurrection</i> and the life: he that believeth in me, though
he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in
me shall never die.&mdash;John, xi. 25, 26.</p>

<p class="smaller">Now is Christ <i>risen</i> from the dead, and become the first-fruits of
them that slept.</p>

dead.</p>

<p class="smaller">For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.&mdash;I.

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
